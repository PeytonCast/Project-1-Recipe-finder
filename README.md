# DREAM TEAM - How to Cook

## Description

This project will be a website that allows users to search for recipies, receive an ingredient shopping list, and YouTube videos on how to cook it.

We plan on using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to pull a recipe and ingredients based on the user's search input.

Then make the ingredients clickable URLs that show where the prodcut can be purchased using the [Kroger Product Search API](https://developer.kroger.com/reference/).

Finally, we'll display YouTube videos on how to cook the recipe using the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).
